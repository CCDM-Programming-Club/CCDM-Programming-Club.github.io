The CCDM programming club is a fortnightly meeting for improving coding skills 
by sharing code and working collaboratively on problems/projects.

There are an ever-increasing number of us writing code to attack our research questions.
We feel that for the most part, CCDM researchers write code in isolation and share only the final, polished results.
This robs everybody of the opportunity to see how others might solve a particular problem, and to learn by watching how each other work.

Check out our [blog](/blog/) for more details of what's happening, or find out more about us below.

## Schedule

Meetings are every second Wednesday from 12-1 pm in B304.307 Curtin University, Australia.

- 2018-05-29 Discussing project ideas and working through Rosalind problems in pairs.
- 2018-06-12 Agenda TBD


## Project goals

- Encourage code sharing
- Encourage collaborative work
- Improve skills for working collaboratively e.g. git, agile practices
- Improve coding and software development skills


## Roadmap

In the first few weeks we will be warming up by working through the
[Rosalind problem set](http://rosalind.info/) and sharing the results.

As the group becomes more confident and established, we will transition to
working collaboratively on small-medium sized software development projects
aimed at solving research problems within the CCDM.
